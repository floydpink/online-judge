A gray code sequence must begin with 0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, given <i>n</i> = 2, return <code>[0,1,3,2]</code>. Its gray code sequence is:</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n00 - 0\r\n01 - 1\r\n11 - 3\r\n10 - 2\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Note:</b><br>\r\nFor a given <i>n</i>, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>For example, <code>[0,2,3,1]</code> is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.</p><p></p>\n              \n                <div>\n                  <p><a href=\"/subscribe/\">Subscribe</a> to see which companies asked this question</p>\n                </div>\n              \n\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div id=\"tags\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-warning\"></div>\n                  <span class=\"hidebutton\"></span>\n                </div>\n              \n\n              \n\n            "
