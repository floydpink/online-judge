The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBoth of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol id=\"hints\">\r\n  <li class=\"hint\">If there are 5 stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to remove the stones such that you will always be the winner? </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jianchao.li.fighter\">@jianchao.li.fighter</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p><p></p>\n              \n                <div>\n                  <p><a href=\"/subscribe/\">Subscribe</a> to see which companies asked this question</p>\n                </div>\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div id=\"similar\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-warning\"></div>\n                  <span class=\"hidebutton\"></span>\n                </div>\n              \n\n            "
