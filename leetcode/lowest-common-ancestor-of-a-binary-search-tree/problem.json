Another example is LCA of nodes <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> is <code>2</code>, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.</p><p></p>\n              \n                <div>\n                  <p><a href=\"/subscribe/\">Subscribe</a> to see which companies asked this question</p>\n                </div>\n              \n\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div id=\"tags\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-warning\"></div>\n                  <span class=\"hidebutton\"></span>\n                </div>\n              \n\n              \n                <div>\n                  <div id=\"similar\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-warning\"></div>\n                  <span class=\"hidebutton\"></span>\n                </div>\n              \n\n            "
